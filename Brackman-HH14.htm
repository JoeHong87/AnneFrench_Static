<font color="#FF0000">modern times Eve -</font> reincarnated - </i>Her eyes are serene, gazing beyond object - looks like she is daydreaming. Her straight posture with her long neck with slanted head - reminds me head of the Venus by Botticelli and yet overall expression of her face is mysteriously serene beyond lust. The nun like white scarf on her head gives paradoxical finishing touch of this great painting. In this painting 
<font color="#FF0000">- <i>Flowers for Jennifer -</i></font> we see the genius of Brackman, who did not follow the exploding trend of New York school in his time, and kept himself in the eternal classics.

<td background="BG-118.gif">&nbsp;<p>Brackman was born on September 25, 1898 in Odessa, Russia and died in 1980. He emigrated to the United States at age ten. He was taught by Robert Henri and George Bellows in New York and he also studied at the Ferrer School in San Francisco. It was not until the 1930's that Brackman began to receive the recognition he would enjoy for the rest of his life. He won many medals and prizes, has works in major museums across the country, and is represented in a large number of corporate collections as an ideal example of modern American art. Robert Brackman was not only a skilled painter, but a passionate teacher as well. He taught in leading schools and museums including the Art Students League in New York City where he was a favorite teacher since the 1930's. Brackman was also an instructor at the Brooklyn Museum, the Minneapolis Art Institute, and his own summer school in Madison, Connecticut.
