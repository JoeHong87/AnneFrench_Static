		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Robert 
		Antoine Pinchon was the second and last child of the Pinchon-Dehame 
		family. He was born on July 1, 1866. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">The father 
		of the young boy was born in Rouen in 1846, brought up in a literary and 
		artistic environment, and became a close friend of Guy de Maupassant. 
		After a stay in Paris, he returned to Rouen in 1880, and became a 
		librarian and also a journalist, first at the “Nouvelliste” and later at 
		the “Journal de Rouen” as a theater critic. In 1894, he published a 
		collection of “theater” with his principal plays: Jacques Gautier, 
		Richard-Without-Fear, Suzanne Dumanoir, Fuchs, A Storm, and Hunter Love. 
		The book is dedicated “to my friend Guy de Maupassant”, who died on July 
		6, 1893.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In 1897 in 
		“Rouen Silhouettes”, Dr. E. Spalikowski gave a friendly insight of the 
		father of the young boy: “... theater critic, Mr. Pinchon is above all a 
		poet....but the main stumbling block for the author is the inaptitude of 
		the actors, who mangle piteously the verses, or recite them in such a 
		way that the audience soon falls asleep...”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Young 
		Robert Antoine studied at the Corneille Lycée, and soon fell in love 
		with drawing and paintings, and at the age of 12 he painted his first 
		canvas. At the Lycée he met Pierre Dumont and Marcel Duchamp. In March 
		1900, he exhibited his first painting in the gallery of Messrs. Dejonghe 
		and Dumont, rue de la Républicque in Rouen. G. Dubosc writes: “...At 
		that moment you could see the early work of a very young Rouen 
		painter...this landscape of the hills of St. Adrien is a study of land 
		bristling with junipers, which already exhibit happy qualities of vision 
		and a solid temperament.” He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-arts de 
		Rouen, where Zacharie taught. In 1903, at the exhibition of the Society 
		of Friends of the Arts of Rouen, the young artist, age 17, hung two 
		paintings on the walls of the museum. In July, at the prize giving at 
		school, he received a medal of excellence for drawing. In September of 
		that same year, he exhibited in Dieppe.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In May 
		1904, the young Robert, thanks to his father’s connections, designed the 
		cover of the program of the Normandy Theater, which showed the “Castle 
		of Miromesnil with the turret where Guy de Maupassant was born, and the 
		villas of Guilette in Étretat”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Francois 
		Depeaux, an informed collector and remarkable supporter of Joseph 
		Delattre and Charles Frechon, took control of the career of the young 
		artist by buying a large part of his production.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In 
		December 1904, the Galerie Legrip opened an exhibition hall in Place Sr. 
		Armand, and Charles Frechon had the honor of inaugurating it, followed 
		by Delattre in February and then Pinchon.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Just 19, 
		Robert Pinchon faced the Rouen public and in April 1905 exhibited a 
		group of 24 paintings. This precocious manifestation was hailed by G. 
		Dubosc and E. Morel who wrote: “...We sincerely congratulate M. R. 
		Pinchon for the enormous effort which this exhibition represents, and 
		the general quality is excellent. It reveals a very organized mind and 
		once he is certain of his direction, will give us remarkable works which 
		will honor this “Rouen School”, whose revelation M. Legrip facilitates 
		so freely to our citizens, who up until now have been the only ones who 
		didn’t know about it....”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">During the 
		summer, Robert Pinchon again sent a painting to the Society of Friends 
		of the Arts of Dieppe and participated in the third Autumn Salon from 
		October 18 to November 25 in Paris, the year of the “Cage of the Wild 
		Beasts”. The next year, Robert Pinchon exhibited two works at the 37th 
		Municipal Salon of Rouen and prepared the decoration of the bar-covered 
		gallery Alhambra, representing the rustic restaurant of Le Bouille, then 
		exhibited a painting at the Autumn Salon in Paris.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">At age 21, 
		the young artist responded favorably to P. Mascart and M. Delaunay, who 
		had just started the Society of Rouen Artists; Pinchon sent six canvases 
		for this first salon. Having formed a close friendship with Pierre 
		Dumont, he followed with great interest the creation of the Group of 
		XXX. A. M. Gossez, a writer and member of the group, explained the 
		necessity of its creation in a letter: “...The eclecticism of the 
		Society of Rouen Artists is excessive, it has a series of exhibitors, 
		who would not distort the masters of chromolithography: however, several 
		of the XXX have made a place there - not without difficulty - they 
		appeared extremely “fauve”...Our judgment is more towards Cezanne and 
		Manet, than towards Monet, although some impressionists like Frechon are 
		attached to you...”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">The first 
		exhibition of the Group of XXX took place at Galerie Legrip from October 
		29 to November 12, and among the 40 paintings of Braque, Derain and 
		Vlaminck, Robert Pinchon exhibited the “Champ de Blé” (Wheat Field).
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">After this 
		surprising exhibition, the Galerie Legrip hosted the Autumn Exhibition, 
		organized by the Management Committee of the Rouen Artists, where 
		Pinchon exhibited a landscape. He participated in the “Almanac for 
		1908”, edited by the Group of XXX, with 450 copies. From March 7 to 
		April 15, he sent six canvases for the second Rouen Artists Salon and 
		spent 1908 preparing a series of “Quais de Rouen” and “Rocks of St. 
		Adrien”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Francois 
		Depeaux became more and more interested in the production of the young 
		artist. On September 23, 1908 he wrote to Pinchon “...Concerning the 
		canvases that you brought to Lescure, I find them much better than the 
		previous ones, and I would be disposed to buy two at the price you 
		indicated to me or 3 for 500F. I would also buy your “July 14” but after 
		some small changes, which I must discuss with you in person. A word of 
		reply please. Your devoted Depeaux”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">At the 
		beginning of 1909, Galerie Legrip held an “Exhibition of Modern 
		Paintings”, where seven Rouen artists and one Parisian exhibited 24 
		canvases, including 5 canvases which gave an excellent insight into the 
		works of Robert Pinchon. This exhibition was announced by a poster of C. 
		la Broue, and P. Hans notes in the Normandy Worker “...We recognize the 
		three inseparables Pinchon, Dumont and Tirvert going into raptures in 
		front of a famous cathedral in flamboyant colors...” and he also wrote: 
		“...A still life of Mr. Pinchon absorbs light to a great extent, the 
		objects that he gathers together are more mundane and much more ‘stuff’ 
		than those of Mr. Dumont...Also, Mr. Pinchon varies his technique in 
		almost every work, proof of competency and confidence...”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Then the 
		artist prepared for his first Paris exhibition, thanks to the generous 
		support of Francois Depeaux. This took place from March 15 to 25 at the 
		Gallery of Modern Artists, at the experts Chaine and Simonson. At the 
		age of 23, Pinchon faced the Paris populace with success, then exhibited 
		at the Salon of Rouen Artists and, then, at the 38th Municipal 
		Exhibition of Beaux Arts of Rouen. He also lent all his support to 
		Pierre Dumont to set up the Normandy Society of Modern Painting and 
		exhibited at Legrip.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In 
		November, at the inauguration of the Depeaux Room at the Rouen Museum, 
		he was particularly well represented with 4 canvases of the 52 paintings 
		generously offered by the collector. The day of the opening, Pinchon 
		rubbed elbows with such renowned painters as Lebourg, Raffaelli, 
		Guillaumin, and with art critics Arsène Alexandre, Rovger Milès and his 
		friends the Rouen painters. At the end of the year he was absent from 
		the first exhibition of the Normandy Society of Modern Painting.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In 1910, 
		he exhibited in May at Legrip, then at Havre and made the front page of 
		the Rouen Gazette on September 10, with two articles: ‘The Man’ by A. 
		Dupuys and ‘His Work’ by E. Morel - the former decorated with a 
		caricature by C. La Broue, the latter by a self portrait. The following 
		year started with a solo exhibition at Legrip, then Pinchon participated 
		in the second Normandy Exhibition of Modern Painting where Pierre Dumont 
		hung the portrait of his friend Pinchon, who sent three works of 
		“Factories at Eauplet”. Side by side with Tirvert and Dumont, we find 
		Robert Pinchon in Paris at the Gallery of Ancient and Contemporary Art 
		with two canvases from November 20 through December 16.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In March 
		1912, he returned to the Exhibition of Rouen Artists with four canvases, 
		then to the 7th Exhibition of the Society of Modern Painting from June 
		15 until July 15, which was held in the great hall of skating of the 
		Lacroix Island in Rouen. The catalogue was prefaced by Elie Faure, and 
		Guillaume Apollinaire came and spoke on the “Sublime Modern”. The 12 
		canvases sent by the artist were very important. Seduced by fauvism, 
		this ardent colorist gave the fullness of his methods. The year 1913 saw 
		three directions: The Legrip Salon, the Salon of Rouen Artists with 8 
		canvases, of which the “Rue de l’Epicerie” belonged to Mr. Bories, the 
		patron of Narcisse Guilbert and the 4th exhibition of the Society of 
		Modern Painting. In the catalogue of this exhibition, we find a 
		caricature of C. LaBroue representing Pinchon, who exhibited 6 works, of 
		which G. Dubosc writes “...A varied ensemble, he has never displayed 
		himself as such a harmonious colorist as in this series of Pont 
		Corneille and Flowers in the open air...”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">After the 
		last exhibition of the Society of Modern Painting where Pinchon hung 3 
		canvases, followed by the Salon of Rouen Artists with 6 canvases, real 
		fire works took place. The opening took place on June 6, the same month, 
		and he continued into July with an exhibition in Swansea, Wales, 
		organized by Fr. Depeaux, called “L’Ecole de Rouen”. G. Dubosc was in 
		charge of the catalogue and three canvases of Pinchon, owned by Fr. 
		Depeaux, called “Wild Flowers at Water’s Edge” were exhibited among 43 
		paintings. On August 3, 1914, Germany declared war on France and the 
		artist was mobilized on August 5th. He was sent to the front and was 
		wounded in the leg at the battle of the Marne on September 16 in 
		Berry-au-Bac. He convalesced in St-Céré, in the Lot, were he received a 
		long letter from Dubosc dated October 18 “...The clan of painters has, 
		of course, been dispersed...I met Dumont, who is fine, and who was 
		preparing to go up to Paris, a little disconsolate, because ‘modern 
		painting’ was being sold everywhere to the Germans...Tirvert had kept 
		his oriental calm and serenity. I don’t know where Paul Pitt is, but La 
		Brou was in the Engineers in Arras...Couchaux was also wounded...”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Pinchon 
		went back to the front as a machine gunner, but was wounded again. In 
		May 1915, the Salon of Active Duty Soldiers took place, and the State 
		acquired the “Quarry of Amfreville-la-Mivoie”. At the end of the year, 
		Pierre Dumont organized the exhibition “For our soldiers, for our 
		artists”. Three paintings of Pinchon were hung in this generous 
		exhibition. The artist returned to the front and during the battle of 
		Verdun, was captured in Thiaumont, and he was detailed to a rural 
		farming community in Germany.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In 1917, 
		he was represented in the 9th Salon of Rouen Artists, where an important 
		retrospective, consecrated to Zacharie took place. The year 1918 passed 
		in captivity, where, thanks to paints, pastels and oils, Pinchon could 
		keep on producing. At the end of the year he escaped, crossed 
		Switzerland, Italy and France and reached Rouen at the end of December. 
		There, the exhibition of Painters of the Sea took place, organized by 
		the French Naval League, at the Rouen Museum. Pinchon was represented 
		here with four paintings.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">Pinchon 
		arrived at the family home, 49 rue Armand Carrel, which he had left four 
		and a half years previously. He participated in the 10th Salon of Rouen 
		Artists, where he exhibited the pastel; drawings of his convalescence in 
		St. Céré, and of his captivity in Germany. During the summer he went to 
		Honfleur and Lisieux, and, in September he vacationed in Brittany at 
		Saint-Jean-du-Doigt and the surrounding area with Jean Charles Contel. 
		He took part in the Autumn Salon in Paris with two other Rouen artists: 
		Paul Mascart and Narcisse Guilbert. From January 26 to February 5, 1920, 
		he exhibited at Galerie Legrip his series of canvases brought back from 
		Brittany, and then some works at Havre in the lobby of the “La Cloche” 
		newspaper, along with 70 paintings of Rouen artists. On October 11, 
		Francois Depeaux, an exceptional collector and man of art, died. Right 
		at the end of the year, on December 6 and 7, the collection of H. Perrot 
		was sold at auction in Rouen - along with 20 Couchaux, 28 Dumont, 42 
		Guilbert and 39 Pinchon, among which was “Factory at Eauplet”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">On January 
		24, 1921, Robert A. Pinchon married Lise Bance and had three children. 
		The artist lent his participation to the opening of the Modern Gallery 
		at Rouen, but suffered from the loss of his friend Paul Pitt on February 
		7. He exhibited again at the Galerie Legrip, and his canvas “The 
		Maraicher Garden” was bought from him at the 39th Municipal Exhibition 
		of Beaux-Arts of Rouen for 800F.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">The first 
		part of the fabulous collection of Fr. Depeaux was dispersed on June 25 
		in Paris, and then on July 19 in Havre, and finally in Rouen on December 
		19. During these three vacations, forty canvases of Pinchon were sold.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">During 
		1922 to 1923, Robert A. Pinchon rejoined the Salon of Rouen Artists, the 
		Galerie Legrip, and also assisted the Modern Gallery in rue St. Romain.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In 1924, 
		the artist developed an important activity: in February, at Legrip, then 
		at the Salon of Rouen Artists, and finally at the Modern Gallery, with 
		“Through Old Rouen” courtyards and streets, 38 large cartoons showing 
		the most picturesque aspects of the town of 100 bells. The next year 
		Pinchon took part in the Salon of Normandy Artists in Paris, exhibited 
		at Legrip, and suffered the loss of his father. He then chose to move to 
		Bois-Guillaume and to prepare for the collection.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">It took 
		place in Paris, at the Reitlinger Gallery, rue de la Boétie from 
		February 16 to March 4, 1926. G. Dubosc, who had faithfully supported 
		the artist, related in the Rouen newspaper of February 18, that this 
		Parisian exhibition was going to give new momentum to the career of the 
		painter. He again exhibited at the Galerie Legrip and at the Museum for 
		the Salon of Rouen Artists. He did the same in 1927, where the year 
		ended with a very important exhibition at the Reitlinger Gallery with 45 
		canvasses, from November 12 to 18. During the exhibition one of his 
		canvases was purchased by the Ministry of Public Instruction and 
		Beaux-Arts.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">In 1928, 
		he took part in two traditional Rouen exhibitions (Legrip and the Salon 
		of Rouen Artists) but also joined two group exhibitions in Budapest and 
		Varsovia, again exhibited at the Reitlinger Gallery, and at the end of 
		the year in Brussels at the Kodak Gallery of Art. In the Rouen Gazette 
		of December 19, 1936, replying to Gontran Sedille, while suffering a 
		great economic crisis, R. Pinchon said: ...Have we or have we not 
		returned in reality to the conditions before 1914? I remember this time 
		and my debut. My friends and I held our first exhibition...naturally we 
		didn’t sell anything! Happily we had our parents...but we needed pocket 
		money, and our canvases ended up - for 20 francs - at father Perreau 
		(sic)”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">After his 
		exhibition at Reitlinger in January 1929, he took part in the Salon of 
		the Society of Rouen Artists in Paris and became a regular member, then 
		at the Salon of French Artists and, then, his annual exhibition at 
		Legrip.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">From 1930 
		to 1939, Robert Pinchon held regularly his three exhibitions, and 
		exhibited twice again at the Salon of French Artists in 1930 and 1932; 
		he became president of the Society of Rouen Artists in 1935, three years 
		after having been named member of the Academy of Rouen.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">The artist 
		remained faithful to Rouen, its banks of the Seine, its old streets, but 
		also the surrounding areas: Honfleur, Etretat, Fécamp, Dieppe. However, 
		he also went to the Midi: Marseilles, St. Tropez, Gassing in 1934, and 
		went twice to Brett in Brittany. In 1935, the Rouen editor, H. 
		Defontaine published the text of Lucia Delarue-Mardrus “Rouen” and 
		Pinchon did the illustrations: the following year, with the same editor, 
		P. Choral gave “Normandy Cathedrals and Churches” from November 20 to 
		30. In the catalogue of this latter exhibition, where there were 41 
		paintings, are quoted press extracts: Chi. Kunstler of the artistic 
		Figure, J. Normal of the Journal des Arts, and F. Guy of the Rouen 
		newspaper: “There is no more need to praise the artist, everyone knows 
		with what acuity he perceives and translates the effects of our Normandy 
		atmosphere, of which his canvases remain as a living reflection”.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">The second 
		volume of “Rouen” was published in 1937. The same year, the artist 
		illustrated “The Castles of Normandy” on a text of Jean de La Varende; 
		he also bought a thatched cottage in Varende, and took part in the 
		exhibitions of the House of Culture in 1937 and 1938.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">The war 
		surprised Pinchon and his family in the house in Varengeville on 
		September 3, 1939. He stopped his Paris exhibitions, and his last 
		exhibition took place at the Hotel de la Couronne, place du Vieux Marche 
		in Rouen, in May and June 1941 under the patronage of Pierre Varenne, a 
		man of letters.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">After 
		having lost two companions dear to his heart in 1942, Narcisse Guilbert 
		on February 23 and Pierre Hode on December 15, Robert Antoine Pinchon 
		died on January 9, 1943.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS Bold">Work 
		and Personality</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS">P.R. Wolf 
		perfectly described the man in the preface of the catalogue of April 
		1958 at the time of the exhibition of R.A. Pinchon and M. Louvrier at 
		the Museum of Beaux-Arts of Rouen: “...In spite of his broad shoulders 
		and rolling gait of a sailor, Pinchon was a timid man, more ‘listener’ 
		than ‘speaker’, and who whinnied in a silent laugh, showing all his 
		horsy teeth. When he composes, Pinchon never forgets the theme, and when 
		he is in the presence of the theme he still composes. He has his natural 
		arabesque which ‘sweeps’ the landscape sometimes towards wallcoverings, 
		sometimes towards decor. We are just a little bit removed from an easy 
		effect, but all is saved by the elegance and the distribution of a 
		harmony, by a broad vision, by the pictorial quality, by the tenderness 
		with which he caresses a tree, a cloud. Even when under the influence of 
		Pierre Dumont, who throws into the Rouen School the leaven of his 
		nervous anxiety of builder, Pinchon ‘beams’ as tender fauvist. He 
		sometimes repeats himself from one theme to another, form one hour to

		Pinchon’s beginnings have been influenced by the three Rouen masters: 
		Lebourg, Delattre, Frechon. Some works, kept by members of the family 
		easily show the sure influence of these three masters, but this period 
		was very quickly exceeded by the astonishing vocation of colorist, which 
		is that of the artist alone. This was brought to light under the 
		stimulus of his friend Pierre Dumont and the Paris exhibitions, where 
		Pinchon gave free rein to the magic of colors. From the war to the 
		period 1925-1930, Pinchon became more and more the colorist, while 
		ornamenting his art with a manifest decorative concern. His career ended 
		with very designed landscapes where he attained perfect synthesis of the 
		elements and made of himself the painter of Normandy light in the 
		lineage of Lebourg.</span></p>
