        <font size="5">Biography of Constantin Kluge</font></p>
        </o:p>
				<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">Constantin Kluge was born in Riga, 
Latvia, on January 29, 1912, in Russia..</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">His father was a graduate of the 
Polytechnic Institute of Riga and his mother a Professor of Literature. Kluge's 
father was drafted into the Czar's army in 1914. Then the chaos of the 1917 
Bolshevik Revolution and the ensuing Civil War completely uprooted the family.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">They moved&nbsp; frequently, always 
eastward, arriving in Manchuria in 1920. Here the little boy learned to speak 
Mandarin. In 1925 the émigré family moved again, this time to the French 
&quot;concession&quot; of Shanghai, where Kluge would graduate from the French Municipal 
High School. </font></p>
        </o:p>
		<o:p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">By the time he was seventeen, he was 
a very active member of the Shanghai Art Club. At this period of his life he 
also took up the violin and cello, and later in Paris gave music lessons to help 
meet his expenses. Meanwhile, his parents had decided that pure art was not a 
dependable career, and so in 1931 Kluge left Shanghai for Paris to study 
architecture. He spent six years at the E’cole des Beaux-Arts and in 1937 
graduated with the title of French Government Architect. </font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">The 
years spent studying and living in the Latin Quarter of Paris had created in 
Kluge a strong attachment to the characteristic scenes of Paris, and, instead of 
returning immediately to Shanghai and his family, he stayed on in Paris for six 
months painting views of Paris in oils, purely to portray and preserve the 
scenes he so loved. The childhood years spent in the Orient had contributed to 
his love of painting. </font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">His professor of Chinese had taught 
him, from the age of ten, a respect for the handling of the brush, and the 
attitude of the Orientals toward the beauties of nature drew the young artist to 
the depiction of beauty and away from the vogue for the ugly and sordid in 
painting. When Kluge returned to China, he practiced his profession of 
architecture for a time. But when his friends persuaded him to exhibit his 
paintings, the exhibitions were so successful and aroused such enthusiasm that 
Kluge felt that painting, his first love, could afford him a livelihood. Kluge 
spent the years of World War 11 in Shanghai and is convinced that he avoided 
trouble with the Japanese occupiers only because of the respect and love the 
Japanese people have for painting.<span style="font-size: 14.0pt"> </span>

mid-1946 he accepted an architectural post in Hong Kong and continued to paint 
in his spare time. In March, 1950, amid rumors that the Chinese Communists might 
invade Hong Kong, Constantin Kluge left Asia for good and returned to his 
beloved Paris, Already a mature and successful painter by the time he reached 
Paris, it is not surprising that he won an award and considerable attention at 
the Paris Salon in 1951. Since that time he has been a frequent exhibitor in the 
Salon shows, which have proved to be his gateways to ever increasing public 
attention, Kluge is a member of the Societe' des Artistes Francais, and his 
works have won prizes at their Salon. In 1961 he was awarded the Medaille 
d'Argent as well as the special Raymond Perreau prize given by the Taylor 
Foundation at&nbsp; the Salon.<span style="font-size: 14.0pt"> </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Baskerville Old Face">I</span>n 
1962 he received the coveted Gold Medal of the Salon. In 1990, Kluge earned one 
of the most prestigious non-military awards bestowed by the French government: 
he was named a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur by the French Ministry of 
Culture. In 1991, Kluge was awarded the Grand Medal of the City of Senlis. 
Completely captivated by the many moods of Paris, Kluge has become absorbed in 
painting this beautiful city. The gaiety and animation of the flower markets; 
the subtly pensive and poetic quiet areas along the Seine; the special quality 
of Paris sunshine in early spring; the quaintness yet sophistication of&nbsp; Pairis 
are wonderfully expressed in his widely varied compositions. His fascination 
with Paris is contagious and the viewer feels drawn into each Kluge painting. In 
addition to Paris scenes, Kluge has sought out quiet, picturesque harbor scenes 
where the colors of water and sails blend to form softly modulated patterns of 
great beauty and interest. As with his paintings along the Seine, Kluge's 
handling of water in these harbor scenes is unusually lovely and convincing.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Baskerville Old Face">P</span>robably 
due to his early architectural training, Kluge has in the past been primarily 
occupied with subjects which include buildings of many types, but pure landscape 
subjects intrigue him as well. In his country scenes of provincial France, where 
sunlight and changing atmospheric qualities present a new challenge, Kluge uses 
the same subtlety and sensitive rendering of beauty found in his other work, It 
is interesting to find this capable painter rounding out his repertoire in such 
varied fashion. While Kluge continues to paint, he is also a writer of 
considerable stature, His autobiography, Constantin Kluge (published in 1987), 
details his fascinating life and includes many color reproductions of his 
paintings.<span style="font-size: 14.0pt"> </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Baskerville Old Face">F</span>rench 
art critics have declared that Constantin Kluge is a painter of poetic realism. 
Kluge paints without affectation, in a frank and straightforward style. His firm 
drawing and well-constructed forms are bathed in an atmosphere of subtle colors. 
He enjoys painting and communicates that joy to the beholder. </font></p>
